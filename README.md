# ML Engineer | Applied Machine Learning

ML Engineer focused on building **production-oriented, data-driven systems**
for real-world business problems.

I work end-to-end with machine learning systems:
from problem formulation and exploratory data analysis
to model development, evaluation, deployment,
and business-focused decision-making.

My core focus is **practical ML**:
robust baselines, interpretable models,
clear evaluation, and solutions that can be realistically
deployed, monitored, and maintained in production.
